## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to support the independence of individuals in the Blind and Visually Impaired (BVI) community by developing a system that helps users identify and safely navigate heat hazards in a kitchen environment.

## Scope of Project
The following section outlines the guaranteed functionality scope that the final deliverable will demonstrate by the end of the project:

Heat Detection and Localization
- The product will be able to detect hot objects/surfaces within a kitchen environment, including, but not limited to, stove elements, kettles, and hot dishes
- The product will be able to accurately identify the location of the identified hazards in the kitchen space

User Tracking
- The product will track a user’s location within the kitchen space, specifically targeting the location of their hands in relation to potential hazards

Real-Time Feedback
- The product will integrate hazard detection and user tracking to deliver real-time feedback to the user in the form of warnings and suggested corrective movements as needed

## Scope of Hazards
The scope of hazards for the project are any heat-related hazards typically encountered in a kitchen environment. This includes but is not limited to hot objects, hot surfaces, and localized heat zones within proximity to the user that can cause injury. These hazards may not be immediately visible to the user without assistance. Other non-heat-related hazards are out of scope such as spills or sharp objects but could be integrated as future functionality.

## Assumptions
The project assumes that: 
- The test kitchen layout will stay consistent enough to use without extensive recalibration of the primary system
- Users have a basic level of mobility, kitchen experience, and an expectation of what feedback the secondary system will provide
- The prototype will be affordable and accessible
